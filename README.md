# dotfiles
please, I need my shortcuts I am begging you

# Usage

likely, you're starting here to mass install a bunch of stuff

```
brew bundle
```

this is probably easier using `stow`

```
git clone git@github.com:Peechiz/dotfiles.git;
cd dotfiles;
stow .;
brew bundle install --file ~/Brewfile
```
